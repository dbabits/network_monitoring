Experimental instructions for OS X
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

 The following instructions should be considered as experimental due to not
 having been verified in several different OS X machines. As with any other
 intructions, errors in any steps should be solved before continuing with
 remaining steps.

 Compiling the binaries requires Xcode to be installed. However, Xcode is
 only used for installing the command line tools. The image output support
 hasn't been verified and isn't therefore installed with these instructions.

 In Xcode, open "Preferences...", then click "Downloads" and install
 "Command Line Tools".

 Open a new terminal and execute

     sudo -s -H

 followed with a password that may be required. Verify that the user is now
 'root' with

     whoami

 Go to the directory where this package was extracted and configure the
 environmant:

     ./configure

 and then compile the binaries:

     make

 This command should not have resulted in any errors. Then proceed on
 installing the configuration file and updating the default interface from
 eth0 to the currently used:

     cp -v cfg/vnstat.conf /etc/
     nano /etc/vnstat.conf

 Create necessary directories, install the binaries and launchd plist file:

     mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
     mkdir -p /usr/local/libexec
     cp -v vnstat /usr/local/bin/
     cp -v vnstatd /usr/local/libexec/
     cp -v examples/launchd/net.humdi.vnstat.plist /Library/LaunchDaemons/
     chown root:wheel /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.humdi.vnstat.plist

 Start the daemon process

     launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/net.humdi.vnstat.plist

 During first startup, the daemon (vnstatd) should list and add all
 available interfaces for monitoring. Depending on configuration, it may
 take some minutes for the 'vnstat' command to begin showing results.
 Monitoring of unwanted interfaces can be stopped with:

     vnstat --delete -i ethunwanted
