What is vnStat
::::::::::::::

 vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor that uses the network
 interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This
 means that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures
 light use of system resources.

 Traffic statistics are stored on a hourly level for the last 24 hours,
 on a daily level for the last 30 days and on a monthly level for the
 last 12 months. Total seen traffic and a top 10 days listing is also
 provided.

 Optional png image output is available in systems with the gd library
 installed.

 See the webpage http://humdi.net/vnstat/ for output examples.


Getting started
:::::::::::::::

 vnStat works best when installed. See the INSTALL or INSTALL_BSD file
 depending on used operating system. Experimental instructions for OS X
 are available in the INSTALL_OSX file. These files contain all needed
 information for the installing process. Instructions for upgrading from
 a previous version are included in the UPGRADE file.
